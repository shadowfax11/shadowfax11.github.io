    I am interested in developing methods for imaging systems or visual display systems using ideas from Image and Signal Processing, Computer Vision, Optics, Deep Learning. I aspire to gain "full-stack knowledge" of imaging systems and use it for novel applications - and in process solve sensing problems in healthcare, robotics, autonomous navigation, AR/VR, etc.

I am interested in exciting opportunities, and happy to talk to people about the same.\
