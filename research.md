I work broadly in the field of Computational Imaging --- which involves co-designing optics, sensors, and algorithms to perform novel sensing tasks. [[Google Scholar]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vXX1cx4AAAAJ&hl=en)

### Projects (Current)
**Computer Vision for Surgical Tool Tracking** <br>
Using the latest advancements in computer vision for tracking surgical tool-tips and other keypoints. We want this tracking to be robust to occlusions/motion blur, and should work on long videos. Such an automated tracking method can potentially enable downstream video analytics, such as surgeon motor skill assessment, learning assessment, etc. 

<!-- ### Automated Cap Alignment for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
Developed a computer vision-based system for automated alignment and fitting of TMS caps, leveraging face tracking and algorithmic optimizations for precise and repeatable positioning. -->

**Split Aperture Coded Computational Photography** <br>
Coded photography has enabled 3D estimation, depth sensing, hyperspectral sensing, etc. I have explored solutions in which a single camera can capture multiple coded images at the same time, leading to better 3D estimation/depth sensing/deblurring. This snapshot multi-coded captures can be achieved by intelligently capturing coded measurements in different dimensions (such as polarization, dual-pixel measurements, etc.). See my ICCP 2022 and CVPR 2024 works.

**Laser Speckle Imaging for Deep Artery Blood Flow Sensing** <br> 
Designing a wearable device and speckle estimation algorithms for sensing blood flow changes in deep-lying peripheral arteries (5-10mm deep).

### Projects (Past)
**Coded Fiber Optics Imaging** <br>
Attempted to use phase masks for 3D estimation or multi-depth imaging using a fiber bundle-based flexible imaging system (HRME). 

**Depth from Defocus + Shape from Polarization** <br>
Attempted to merge depth from defocus cues with polarimetric signal cues that give object shapes.   

**2D Phase Unwrapping** <br>
Designed optimization-based 2D phase unwrapping algorithms. See my NCC 2018 and TGRS 2021 works.
