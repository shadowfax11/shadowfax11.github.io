I found it was way harder than what I expected to get everything to work to create this website. Ultimately what helped best were these YouTube videos: \
[How to make a personal website with github pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZsgPgGdOzQ&t=1145s) \
[Making and hosting your personal website using Jekyll and Github pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkxcaxRacA) \
(You might need to install Ruby, Bundler, and Jekyll for this)
